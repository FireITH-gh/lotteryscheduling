# Lottery Scheduling Algorithm

This is a C++ program that uses a random lottery system to select the next process to be run in a given queue. To execute: you will need to compile and run the lottery.cpp file using a C++ compiler

Instructions: The program will ask the user to initialize the queue with a number of processes and a number of tickets assigned to each process. After this, the user will be asked if they would like to run the lottery.

After initialization, the user will be brought to the main menu, where they will have the following options:

  1: Add more processes
  2: Add more tickets
  3: Run the lottery
  4: Add tickets to a specific process
  5: Exit
